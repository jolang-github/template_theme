This plugin is responsible for making certain fields mandatory before publishing any post in wordpress.

== Description ==
Please Download The Version 1.6.2

Before publishing normally we would like to mandate certain fields which are important like Title,Description,Meta keywords,etc. These fields are actually the basic fields to be filled in before publishing any post but it might slip out from the author's mind unintentionally. In order to avoid this behavior we have developed this plugin which will ensure that all the fields decided by the admin should be filled in before posting any material.

This plugin can be customized to mandate upto 5 fields currently. This plugin plays a very useful role in case of mandating 'Meta keywords' field which help in bringing up your site in the initial pages of search engines like 'Google','Bing',etc. In this way it plays an important role in SEO.
